# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a frontend developer with the passion to solve problems and build new things. I have a wide array of experiences which I gained through different avenues.


## Projects

### Web-Apps


<table>
  
  <tr>
    <td>A React Webapp project that showcases vehicles for rent. There is a fully functional search bar and sort function. All the vehicle data is obtained through an API.</td>
    <td>A Whatsapp clone webapp made with React. Google Authentication was used for login. Features include the ablity to create chatrooms, chat with people in real-time, messages are saved on a database with a timestamp and more.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A User Management System to store and track client data. This app was made with ExpressJS, NodeJS, and MongoDB.</td>
    <td>A sleek To-Do web-app, made using React. Implemented this app using components, hooks, states, props, and more. Full CRUD functionality, used
        Firebase for data handling.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### Python Games
<p>As a hobby I like to create Python games using the PyGame framework. I also use these games to teach children how to code. Here are some of them:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>A card memory game</td>
    <td>A maze game - players have to find their way out of this maze. The maze is randomly generated in a different pattern each time.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>A 2D monster chasing game, players have to get as many points as they can before time runs out.</td>
    <td>Pong - I'm sure you know how it works.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

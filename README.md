# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 4th-year computer science student with the passion to solve problems and build new things. I have a wide array of experiences which I gained through different avenues. I am looking for internship opportunities and junior positions to learn new skills and gain new experiences.

### Python Games
